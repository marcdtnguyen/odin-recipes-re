    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy chicken mushroom fettuccine is elegant, but easy enough to pull together. Chicken cutlets and
        mushroom sauce cook in a single skillet, and are served over fettucine. It's a comforting meal with garlic bread
        and a simple green salad.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breast</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Shallots</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>White wine</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Half and half</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fettuccine pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat cutlets dry with paper towels; season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>

        <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. When hot, add seasoned
            cutlets and brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove cutlets to a plate and keep warm.
        </li>

        <li>
            To the same skillet, add 1 additional tablespoon olive oil, and stir in mushrooms. Cook 3 to 5 minutes,
            stirring
            occasionally, then add shallots and garlic, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds.
        </li>

        <li>
            Pour in wine, stir, and return chicken cutlets and any accumulated juices to the skillet. Cover, reduce
            heat,
            and cook chicken until juices no longer run pink and an instant read thermometer inserted near the center
            reads
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from heat, 8 to 10 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil
            until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Whisk flour and 2 tablespoons water together in a small bowl to create a slurry. Gradually whisk in about
            1/3
            cup cooking liquid from the skillet. Return skillet to medium heat; stir in the slurry and half and half.
            Bring
            sauce to a boil, stirring frequently, until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Remove from heat again, and stir in 1/3 cup grated Parmesan and minced parsley. Stir until the cheese is
            melted.
            Taste the sauce and adjust salt and pepper, if necessary.
        </li>

        <li>
            Drain fettuccine; divide fettuccine and cutlets into 6 servings. Pour on sauce and garnish with remaining
            grated
            Parmesan and flat-leaf parsley sprigs, if using. Serve warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
